# Cycle_GAN
Domain Translation of Images using CycleGAN

## What is CycleGAN?
Image-to-image translation problem describes translating an image from domain A to domain B. The main goal of CycleGAN is to solve the image-to-image translation problem.
One popular application of CycleGAN is Style Transfer which is used to make an image look like a painting, colorize the image and so on.

## Dataset
Edges2shoes data set is used for CycleGAN training. This data set is widely used in many variations of
GAN network. This data set is actually paired (paired means a matched pair of images in edges domain and shoes domain), 
but CycleGAN can to train on an unpaired data set as well. <br><br>
<p align = "center">
  <img src = "/Images/dataset_1.jpeg" height = 700>
</p>

## Results
The CycleGAN was used to convert the images of edges to shoes and vice versa. Some results can be seen below: <br><br>
<img src = "/Images/result_1.png" height = 300> <img src = "/Images/result_2.png" height = 300>
<img src = "/Images/result_3.png" height = 300> <img src = "/Images/result_4.png" height = 300>
